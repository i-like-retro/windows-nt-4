listed below.

Author
------

Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad <pf@zsh.org>.
Zsh is now maintained by the members of the zsh-workers mailing list
<zsh-workers@sunsite.auc.dk>.  Revision of version 3.0 is currently
coordinated by Bart Schaefer <schaefer@zsh.org>.  New development is
currently coordinated by Peter Stephenson <pws@zsh.org>.  The
coordinator can be contacted at <coordinator@zsh.org>, but matters
relating to the code should generally go to the mailing list.
