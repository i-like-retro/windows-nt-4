On all machines if you use gcc and upgrade your OS you must rebuild gcc
after the OS upgrade.  A gcc left from a previous OS may seem to work but
compiling more complex programs may fail mysteriously.

These are the architectures that zsh has been tried on.  If you
succeed in getting zsh to work on an architecture not listed, let
us know.

Apple:	Mac with MiNT after redefining the zgetwd() function as getwd().

Cray:	C90 and T90 Cray machines with Unicos
	Should build `out-of-the-box',

Data General: various AViiONs running DG/UX 5.4R3.10 MU01
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

DEC:	Alpha with Ultrix
	DECstation with Ultrix
	DECstation 5000/25 with Mach 3.0
	Alpha with OSF/1 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 3.x and (DEC Unix) 4.x

	In OSF/1 3.x, there is apparently a bug in the header file
	/usr/include/rpcsvc/ypclnt.h; the prototype for yp_all() has a
	struct ypall_callback as its final argument, which should be a
	pointer (struct ypall_callback *).  This prevents compilation
	of one of zsh' files (zle_tricky.c).  If you can't modify the
	header file, create a directory called `rpcsvc' in zsh's Src
	subdirectory and put a fixed version of the header file to it
	before compiling.

	The strip coming with gcc-2.7.2 seems to create unusable
	binaries.  This problem is not related to zsh.  If you have such
	problems, remove the bogus strip and use /bin/strip instead.

DYNIX/ptx 1.4 and 2.0.4 with X11

HP:	HP-UX 9
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

	HP-UX 10.20
	sed seems to be broken on HP-UX 10.20 which prevents prototype
	generation and the result is that zsh fails to compile.  sed in
	HP-UX 9.x works.  Get an older working sed, get GNU sed or try to
	get a fixed version from your OS vendor.  If you can hack a
	makepro.sed which works with HP-UX 10.20 sed, please send it to
	zsh-workers@math.gatech.edu.

IBM:	AIX
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

Linux:	If you are using an early minor version of libc 5, then a bug
	in the auto-configuration process may cause zsh to think that
	your system doesn't support the lstat function.  If the
	configure process reports that there is no lstat, edit
	config.h and change HAVE_LSTAT to 1.
	libc-5.2.18 or later does not have this problem.

	Some versions of glibc2 have a conflict with <asm/resource.h>
	which causes a redefinition warning on RLIM_INFINITY.  This
	causes configure to decide that <sys/resource.h> is not present,
	which can cause compilation errors in zsh's rlimit code.  The
	best solution is to edit config.h after running configure and
	#define HAS_SYS_RESOURCE_H.

	If you create a symbolic link from /dev/fd to /proc/self/fd, zsh
	will use this for process substitution.  This link must exist
	according to the Linux standards but some distributions come
	without it.

NetBSD:	NetBSD 1.x
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

Next:	NextStep 3.x
	Zsh should build easily on NextStep, but the zsh
	malloc routines are not recommended.

	OpenStep 4.2
	Builds and runs `out-of-the-box' with gcc 2.8.1 and gawk 2.15.

SCO:

SGI:	IRIX 5.1.1.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.2 and 6.3
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

Sony:	NWS with NEWS-OS 3.3

SUN:	SunOS 4.1.x
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.
	Under 4.1.3 if yellow pages is used, username completion
	may cause segmentation violation.  This is a bug in the
	shared library not in zsh.  Some libc.so.1.9.x has this
	bug (it fails in yp_all).  Statically linked binaries will
	work if linked with libc.so.1.8.1 (which means that if
	you can get a statically linked binary compiled under 4.1.2
	that it will probably work).
	An alternative but untested solution may be to undefine
	HAVE_NIS in config.h.  This may work, but the first username
	completion will be _very_ slow (as slow as in tcsh).

	Solaris 2.x
	The UCB versions of the routines for reading directories are
	not usable (the struct definitions are incompatible with the
	ones assumed by zsh).  The symptom of this is that globbed
	filenames in the compiled version of zsh will be missing the
	first two letters.  To avoid this, make sure you compile zsh
	without any reference to /usr/ucblib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
	You can easily do this by just unsetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	before building zsh.
