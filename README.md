What is this?
=============

This repository contains some hints, tips, links and software to
help you setup at least somehow comfortable environment in
Windows NT 4 Workstation in year 2022.

I am trying to collect in one place all the latest information on
required updates, problems, available software, etc. I also try to
compile and backport some modern open source software to run on
Windows NT 4.

Why? Because I like this retro OS :)

If you would like to find your favorite software in this repository,
working on Windows NT 4, just create a GitHub issue. I will take a look!

CD Image
========

For your convenience, you can build an ISO image with all useful
stuff in this repository to burn on CD and apply to your Windows NT4
installation at once.

To build ISO image just run [makecd.cmd](makecd.cmd) command from the root of
the repository. No additional software is needed to build ISO image, all
dependencies are already in the repo.

If you want to recompile software from source code, you can use the
[compile.cmd](Src/compile.cmd) script. It does not have external dependencies,
everything needed is either provided in the [Toolchain](Toolchain) library
or is built by the script itself. Running it without arguments will compile
everything, or you can pass a name or multiple names of the packages to build.

Updates
=======

Important Updates
-----------------

The first thing you would like to do after you install fresh Windows NT 4
is to install latest system and security updates. These updates are highly
recommended to install. They improve user experience and increase
compatibility with software.

**I**) The first thing to consider is of course the latest Service Pack 6A for
the system: [SP6AI386.EXE](CD/SOFTWARE/UPDATES/SP6AI386.EXE). Don't forget to
restart after installing the Service Pack. **On Windows NT 4 it is very
important to restart each time an update is installed (there are exceptions
though, see below), because otherwise you may end up with a newer DLL being
overriden by an older update.**

**II**) After you install latest Service Pack, good idea will be to install
Post-SP6A Service Rollup release. This is the collection of patches, prepared
by Microsoft after SP6 came out. This was intended to be SP7, but it never seen
the light of the day. For more information you can check out the corresponding
[KB article](https://github.com/jeffpar/kbarchive/tree/master/kb/299/Q299444).
You can find the executable here:
[Q299444I.EXE](CD/SOFTWARE/UPDATES/Q299444I.EXE). Don't forget to restart
after installation as well.

**III**) After these two important big patches are installed, its time for the
smaller ones. After Service Rollup came out, there were some smaller security
updates that are nice to install as well. **NOTE**: Each of the updates
requires reboot, but there is a helper tool from Microsoft you could use to
avoid restarting after each update. Download the
[QCHAIN.EXE](CD/SOFTWARE/UPDATES/QCHAIN.EXE) file and run it after installing
all the updates but before restarting the system. You may need to give
proper command line parameters to the updates to prevent them from restarting
the system (usually its "-z" flag). The version of QCHAIN.EXE in this
repository is the newer one from the Q815062 update, with some bugfixes.
For more information search for "QCHAIN.EXE" in the following articles:

**IV**) Now its time to install IE4. **Make sure to do this before you install
IE6, otherwise you won't be able to install it later!** This version will
update your shell with support for 256-colored icons, font smoothing and other
improvements. Just make sure to enable this feature during installation. To
install, run IE4SETUP.EXE from the [IE4](CD/SOFTWARE/UPDATES/IE4) directory.

**V**) After IE4 has been installed, you can install IE6 SP1 to get the latest
supported Internet Explorer on your system. This won't really help to browse
Internet, but it will install newer versions of some important system
components and improve overall compatibility with the software. Run
IE6SETUP.EXE from the [IE6SP1NT](CD/SOFTWARE/UPDATES/IE6SP1NT) directory.

Optional Updates
----------------

These updates are not necessary to install, but may be needed by some software
and are still recommended.

**I**) To support MSI installers, it is also highly recommended to install
MSI 2.0 update. It won't support newest MSI packages, but will definitely
improve a range of software that can be installed on the Machine. Grab it here:
[INSTMSIW.EXE](CD/SOFTWARE/UPDATES/INSTMSIW.EXE).

**II**) Microsoft Data Access Components
([MDAC_TYP.EXE](CD/SOFTWARE/UPDATES/MDAC_TYP.EXE)) and Microsoft Jet database
engine ([JETSETUP.EXE](CD/SOFTWARE/UPDATES/JETSETUP.EXE)) are
used by some software, most notably big Microsoft software packages like
Microsoft Office and Visual Studio.

**III**) .NET Framework. Yes, you can install it on Windows NT 4!
Unfortunately, the latest version you can install is only 1.1. But still, it
improves compatibility considerably and is recomended for installation.
Installers for .NET Framework 1.0
([DOTNETFX.EXE](CD/SOFTWARE/UPDATES/DOTNETFX.EXE)) and .NET Framework 1.1
([DOTNET11.EXE](CD/SOFTWARE/UPDATES/DOTNET11.EXE)) are available.

**IV**) [MSIMG32.DLL](CD/SOFTWARE/UPDATES/DLLS/MSIMG32.DLL). Some software
requires this library. Multiple versions of the library can be found and most
of them require Windows 2000 or newer, and will not work on Windows NT 4. On
the other hand, version in this repository works perfectly. Just copy it to
your \WINNT\SYSTEM32 directory.

freeware audio player from late 90s - early 2000s. Included here are latest
versions from three generations (player was heavily modified between major
versions). Version 2.95 is the most lightweight, while later versions
have more features and are more visually appealing. Version 5.0.94 is not the
latest one that starts on Windows NT 4 (in my tests the latest version to be
able to start was 5.35), but later versions display various errors and seem
to only provide partial functionality.

viewer and image editor program for Windows. **NOTE**: this program should
be purchased for use.

to run many classic MS-DOS games completely unmodified.

Software Development
--------------------

* [CMake 3.5.2](CD/SOFTWARE/DEVEL/CMAKE352.EXE) `2018-12-03`: free and open
source tool for generating project files for C and C++ projects. This is not
the latest version, but its the latest one to support Visual C++ 6.0 and
Visual Studio 7 (aka .NET 2002). So there is little benefit in using newer

[NSIS 3.08](CD/SOFTWARE/DEVEL/NSIS308.EXE) `2021-09-25` also installs
and works perfectly on Windows NT 4, but it seems to be unable to parse
scripts used by CMake. For this reason it is recommended to install NSIS 2.x
if you plan to use it together with CMake.
